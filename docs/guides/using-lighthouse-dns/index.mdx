# Using Experimental Lighthouse DNS with Nebula

:::caution

Lighthouse DNS in nebula is Experimental and not intended to be a robust solution currently.

:::

Nebula comes with built-in DNS server support in the Lighthouse hosts.

Lighthouse DNS can generate DNS records based on dynamic nebula hosts, useful if you are spinning up new nebula hosts on
demand.

An alternative approach to DNS would be to point public DNS records at private nebula IP addresses. For example, you can
create a public DNS A record pointing to `10.0.0.23` for your private team wiki. While this does make your internal IP
address visible to the internet, only users on your nebula network will be able to access it.

To get started, set up a lighthouse and two hosts using our [Quick Start guide](/docs/guides/quick-start/).

You can then use [`lighthouse.serve_dns`](/docs/config/lighthouse#lighthouseserve_dns) and the
[`lighthouse.dns`](/docs/config/lighthouse#lighthousedns) config settings for your lighthouse config file to enable
Lighthouse DNS.

:::note

Only Lighthouses should have `lighthouse.serve_dns` enabled, as DNS info is collected when hosts report to the
lighthouse. Nebula will not honor the option if enabled on a non-lighthouse host.

:::

You'll then want to set up the lighthouse as a DNS server for the other two hosts. This can be either the public static
lighthouse IP or the private nebula IP depending on the Lighthouse's configuration. By setting `lighthouse.dns.host` to
`[::]`, nebula will bind to all interfaces, including both the public and nebula IP. Binding to only the nebula IP, for
example `lighthouse.dns.host: 10.0.0.1` will ensure the DNS is only accessible to hosts that are allowed to contact the
lighthouse via nebula.

## Tutorial

First, spin up a lighthouse and 2 hosts. Then add

```yaml
lighthouse:
  serve_dns: true
  host: [::]
  port: 53
```

to your config for your lighthouse as well as a [firewall rule](/docs/config/firewall) in your lighthouse config that
enables UDP on port `53` for all hosts you want to be able to query DNS on the lighthouse. For example to allow only
hosts with the `role:Laptop` group:

```yaml
firewall:
  inbound:
    - port: 53
      proto: UDP
      group: role:Laptop
```

Then you can run `dig` against it to test! For example, I made a host named `lighthouse` as my lighthouse with nebula IP
`100.100.0.1` and `alice-laptop` with nebula IP `100.100.0.2` as my host, and I set up my lighthouse with the above
config / firewall rule.

```bash
dig @100.100.0.1 +short alice-laptop A
100.100.0.2
```

I can also query the TXT record for the nebula IP for certificate info. Each piece of info is delivered within quotes
and as a `"Key: Value"` format.

```bash
dig @100.100.0.1 +short "100.100.0.2" TXT
"Name: alice-laptop" "Ips: [100.100.0.2/22]" "Subnets []" "Groups [role:Laptop]" "NotBefore 2022-12-06 21:34:25 +0000 UTC" "NotAFter 2024-05-13 17:37:27 +0000 UTC" "PublicKey 2c4828672fef1306124df94eb0fecd753e462e1bd4107f866f4e1a463550eb1b" "IsCA false" "Issuer 5b568aedaa5d97746e870f01a356ba474cf3251c0e743499ec668f93efa77f51"
```

If I then host a server on `[::]:3000` (ex, by creating an index.html file and then running
`python3 -m http.server 3000` on a \*nix host) on `alice-laptop` and set up a firewall rule that allows this to be
accessed from `bob-laptop`, I can request it with `curl` using the custom DNS resolver. (In a production environment,
you may choose to configure the system resolver.)

```bash
curl --dns-servers "100.100.0.1" http://alice-laptop:3000
<div>hello i am a website</div>
```

## Name hosts with valid domain names

Hosts with names conforming to the [DNS RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-2.3.1) will be resolved,
otherwise the Lighthouse DNS will return an empty response.

import { ValidateDomainInput } from './ValidateDomainInput';

<ValidateDomainInput />

## Q&A

- How do hostnames turn into DNS host names?
  - If the hostname is a valid DNS name, it will be resolved by the Lighthouse DNS resolver.
- Do Lighthouse DNS queries support Unicode?
  - DNS only supports ASCII, but has [support for Unicode via punycode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492), for
    example:
    ```bash
    # `alice-xn--3s8h` = `alice-ðŸ’»` in punycode.
    dig @100.100.0.1 +short alice-xn--3s8h A
    100.100.0.2
    ```
    Nebula supports full unicode strings in the host name, but for hosts to be discovered via Lighthouse DNS, they must
    conform to the DNS spec. <https://www.punycoder.com/> is a useful tool for conversion.
- Are the domain names case-sensitive?
  - Currently the DNS server matches names case sensitively, though DNS is
    [meant to resolve case-insensitively](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-2.3.3).
    [slackhq/nebula/issues/776](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/issues/776) is tracking this issue.
- How do duplicate hostnames get resolved?
  - In nebula, a node's IP address is the only identifier that MUST be globally unique. Therefore, it's possible to have
    two hosts with the same certificate name, but different IP addresses. Unfortunately, this can cause inconsistent
    results when querying for these hosts' hostname as the DNS query is ambiguous. The lighthouse will return the nebula
    IP of whichever host it has most recently performed a handshake with.
- How does the lighthouse learn about hosts?
  - Hosts connect to the lighthouse as they normally do, and in doing so the lighthouse learns about their cert. Due to
    this fact, the lighthouse can only answer questions about hosts it has seen since last start.
- Can the lighthouse resolve its own name?
  - As of nebula `v1.6.1`, no, the lighthouse only responds about hosts it has handshaked with, it never handshakes with
    itself. [slackhq/nebula/issues/560](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/issues/560) is tracking this feature.
