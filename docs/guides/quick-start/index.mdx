# How to create your first overlay network

## Components of a Nebula network

### Lighthouse

In Nebula, a lighthouse is a Nebula host that is responsible for keeping track of all of the other Nebula hosts, and
helping them find each other within a Nebula network.

### Certificate Authority

In its simplest form, a Nebula Certificate Authority (CA) consists of two files, a CA certificate, and an associated
private key. A CA certificate is distributed to, and trusted by, every host on the network. The CA private key should
not be distributed, and can be kept offline when not being used to add hosts to a Nebula network.

### Hosts

A Nebula host is simply any single node in the network, e.g. a server, laptop, phone, tablet. The Certificate Authority
is used to sign keys for each host added to a Nebula network. A host certificate contains the name, IP address, group
membership, and a number of other details about a host. Individual hosts cannot modify their own certificate, because
doing so will invalidate it. This allows us to trust that a host cannot impersonate another host within a Nebula
network. Each host will have its own private key, which is used to validate the identity of that host when Nebula
tunnels are created.

## Prerequisites

This section will walk you through setting up a simple nebula network for testing. The examples will need to be modified
to suit your particular environment.

### Downloading Nebula

To start, you'll need to download Nebula for your specific platform(s). Specifically you'll need `nebula-cert` and the
specific `nebula` binary for each platform you use.

#### Desktop and Server

Check the [releases](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/releases/latest) page for downloads

- Linux - 64 and 32 bit, arm, mips, and others
- Windows
- macOS
- Freebsd

#### Mobile

- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mobile-nebula/id1509587936)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.defined.mobile_nebula)

#### From source

You can also compile nebula from source using instructions provided [on GitHub.](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/)

#### Extracting the binaries

Once you have downloaded Nebula for your specific platform, you'll need to extract the `nebula` and `nebula-cert` files.

```shell
tar -xzf nebula-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Creating your first certificate authority

:::note

Since Nebula v1.7.0, it is possible to encrypt the Nebula CA private key using AES-256-GCM encryption and Argon2id key
derivation. If you do not plan to store the private key in encrypted storage (e.g. Ansible Vault or AWS Secrets
Manager), it is recommended that you use the built-in encryption feature.

To encrypt your Nebula private key, pass the `-encrypt` flag when generating the CA and you will be prompted for a
passphrase. Keep it safe - you will be prompted for it each time you sign a host using the encrypted CA key.

The default Argon2 parameters are taken from the "FIRST RECOMMENDED" suggestion in the
[Argon2 RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9106/) (1 iteration, 4 lanes parallelism, 2 GiB RAM.) To select your
own parameters, use the `-argon-iterations`, `-argon-parallelism`, and `-argon-memory` CLI flags.

:::

Nebula uses certificate authorities to identify individual hosts within a Nebula network. The very first step in
creating your own Nebula network is to create a certificate authority for your organization. As you add new hosts to
your Nebula network, your certificate authority is used to create credentials that prove a host should be trusted by
your organization.

```shell
./nebula-cert ca -name "Myorganization, Inc"
```

This will create files named `ca.key` and `ca.cert` in the current directory. The `ca.key` file is the **most
sensitive** file you'll create, because it is the key used to sign the certificates for individual nebula hosts. Please
store this file somewhere safe, preferably with strong encryption.

:::info

By default, this CA will be created with a one-year expiration, and all certificates signed will be valid until one
second before expiration of the CA.

Be sure to set up an alert or calendar event to rotate your CA and certificates before then to ensure continued
connectivity!

:::

Pass `-duration XXhXXmXXs` to set a custom duration for the CA to be valid at creation, for example `-duration 17531h`
would generate a CA valid for just under two years.

## Building a Nebula network

### Establishing a Lighthouse

Nebula lighthouses allow hosts to find each other, anywhere in the world. Lighthouses are the only hosts in a Nebula
network whose IP addresses should not change. Running a lighthouse requires very few compute resources, and you can
easily use the least expensive option from a cloud hosting provider. If you're not sure which provider to use, a number
of us have used $5/mo [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplets as lighthouses.

Once you have launched an instance, ensure that Nebula UDP traffic (default port udp/4242) can reach it over the
internet and is not blocked by any inbound firewall.

### Creating Keys and Certificates

This assumes you have three hosts, which we will name `lighthouse1`, `laptop`, and `server`. You can name the hosts any
way you'd like, including FQDN. You'll also need to choose the Nebula IP address for each host when generating its
certificate. In this example, we are creating a Nebula network that uses the subnet `192.168.100.x/24`, and will assign
IP addresses to each host from within this subnet. This example also demonstrates nebula groups, which can later be used
to define traffic rules in a nebula network.

```shell
./nebula-cert sign -name "lighthouse1" -ip "192.168.100.1/24"
./nebula-cert sign -name "laptop" -ip "192.168.100.5/24" -groups "laptop,ssh"
./nebula-cert sign -name "server" -ip "192.168.100.9/24" -groups "servers"
```

:::info

Without passing a `-duration XXhXXmXXs` flag, certificates will be valid up until one second before their signing CA
expires.

### Configuring Nebula

_Note: For the following examples, we use the address 198.51.100.1 as the routable ip for a fictional lighthouse. You'll
need to substitute the routable IP of your own lighthouse when creating your Nebula configuration files._

#### Configuration files

Download a copy of the nebula
[example configuration](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/examples/config.yml). Make two separate copies of
the example configuration file, one for your lighthouse named `config-lighthouse.yaml`, and one that for every
non-lighthouse host, called `config.yaml`.

```shell
curl -o config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slackhq/nebula/master/examples/config.yml
cp config.yml config-lighthouse.yaml
cp config.yml config.yaml
```

#### Lighthouse configuration (`config-lighthouse.yaml`)

On the lighthouse host, you'll need to ensure `am_lighthouse: true` is set. Generally, a lighthouse will not have any
entries in its `static_host_map`, because all hosts will report themselves to a lighthouse. If you use multiple
lighthouses, they do not generally need to know about each other.

```yaml
static_host_map:

lighthouse:
  am_lighthouse: true
```

#### Host configuration (`config.yaml`)

On the individual hosts, ensure the lighthouse is defined properly in the `static_host_map` section, and is added to the
lighthouse `hosts` section.

```yaml
static_host_map:
  '192.168.100.1': ['198.51.100.1:4242']

lighthouse:
  am_lighthouse: false
  interval: 60
  hosts:
    - '192.168.100.1'
```

#### Firewall settings

The example configuration file allows all outbound traffic but only allows specific connections in to each Nebula host.
You should modify these settings to allow traffic to/from hosts within your network.

```yaml
firewall:
  outbound:
    # Allow all outbound traffic from this node
    - port: any
      proto: any
      host: any

  inbound:
    # Allow icmp between any nebula hosts
    - port: any
      proto: icmp
      host: any
```

### Running Nebula

With the configuration, certificate, and key files created, the last step is copying the appropriate files to each host
and starting your Nebula network.

#### Lighthouse

1. Copy the `nebula` binary, along with the `config-lighthouse.yaml`, `ca.crt`, `lighthouse1.crt`, and `lighthouse1.key`
   to your lighthouse. **DO NOT COPY `ca.key` TO YOUR LIGHTHOUSE.**

2. SSH to your lighthouse.

3. Create a directory named `/etc/nebula` on your lighthouse host.
   ```shell
   mkdir /etc/nebula
   ```
4. Move the configuration, certificates, and key into the appropriate directory.

   _Note_: The example configuration assumes your host certificate and key are named `host.crt` and `host.key`, so
   you'll need to rename some of the files when you move them to the appropriate directory.

   ```shell
   mv config-lighthouse.yaml /etc/nebula/config.yaml
   mv ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt
   mv lighthouse.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt
   mv lighthouse.key /etc/nebula/host.key
   ```

5. Start Nebula

   ```shell
   ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yaml
   ```

#### Hosts

_For this example, we are configuring the host created above, named `server`. Please substitute the correct file names
as appropriate._

1. Copy the `nebula` binary, along with the `config.yaml`, `ca.crt`, `server.crt`, and `server.key` to the host named
   `server`. **DO NOT COPY THE `ca.key` FILE.**

2. SSH to the host you've named `server`.

3. Create a directory named `/etc/nebula` on the Nebula host.
   ```shell
   mkdir /etc/nebula
   ```
4. Move the configuration, certificates, and key into the appropriate directory.

   _Note_: The example configuration assumes your host certificate and key are named `host.crt` and `host.key`, so
   you'll need to rename some of the files when you move them to the appropriate directory.

   ```shell
   mv config.yaml /etc/nebula/config.yaml
   mv ca.crt /etc/nebula/ca.crt
   mv server.crt /etc/nebula/host.crt
   mv server.key /etc/nebula/host.key
   ```

5. Start Nebula

   ```shell
   ./nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yaml
   ```

#### Verifying it all works

You should now be able to ping other hosts running nebula (assuming ICMP is allowed). To ping the example lighthouse,
run:

```shell
ping 192.168.100.1
```

### Adding hosts to your network

It is easy to add hosts to an established Nebula network. You simply create a new host certificate and key, and then
follow the steps under Running Nebula. You will not need to make changes to your lighthouse or any other hosts when
adding hosts to your network, and existing hosts will be able to find new ones via the lighthouse, automatically.
