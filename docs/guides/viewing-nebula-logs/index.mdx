# Viewing Nebula Logs

This guide explains how to view logs for Nebula in each of the supported platforms. Please note that these instructions
are approximations as there are many ways that Nebula can be installed.

## Linux

:::note

These instructions assume that you either installed Nebula using your distribution's package manager or by copying the
[example systemd unit](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/examples/service_scripts/nebula.service) from the
Github repository.

:::

### Logs

```bash
journalctl --unit=nebula --follow
```

### Service status

```bash
systemctl status nebula
```

```bash
# outputs
● nebula.service - Nebula overlay networking tool
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/nebula.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2022-11-30 16:07:48 CST; 2min 3s ago
   Main PID: 546 (nebula)
      Tasks: 10 (limit: 4560)
     Memory: 19.2M
     CGroup: /system.slice/nebula.service
             └─546 /usr/local/bin/nebula -config /etc/nebula/config.yml

# ... shows nebula logs ...
```

## macOS

:::

### Logs

```bash
sudo tail -f /opt/homebrew/var/log/nebula.*
```

Another useful tool for viewing logs is the built-in [Console.app](https://support.apple.com/guide/console/welcome/mac).

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> in the file picker, which will allow you to enter `/opt/homebrew/var/log/nebula.log`
into the textbox.

```bash
launchctl list homebrew.mxcl.nebula
```

```bash
{
	"StandardOutPath" = "/opt/homebrew/var/log/nebula.log";
	"LimitLoadToSessionType" = "Aqua";
	"StandardErrorPath" = "/opt/homebrew/var/log/nebula.log";
	"Label" = "homebrew.mxcl.nebula";
	"OnDemand" = false;
	"LastExitStatus" = 256;
	"Program" = "/opt/homebrew/opt/nebula/bin/nebula";
	"ProgramArguments" = (
		"/opt/homebrew/opt/nebula/bin/nebula";
		"-config";
		"/opt/homebrew/etc/nebula/config.yml";
	);
};
```
