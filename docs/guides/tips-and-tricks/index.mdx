# Tips and Tricks

Make sure you get your preferred overlay network correct, because you will have to re-cert every host if you want to
change your subnet.

Nebula doesn't use X509, it has its own custom-built certificate format defined via protobuffs:
https://github.com/slackhq/nebula/blob/master/cert/cert.proto. The encryption algorithm uses the well tested Noise
protocol.

Nebula subnets must be contiguous, you cannot have a `10.0.0.0/8` and `172.16.0.0/16` in the same cert, if you want
multiple separate subnets it requires multiple Nebula networks with incompatible certs.

Nebula has multiple options for encryption key material: `25519` or `p256`. It's required that you choose one and only
one for your network, as different encryption algorithims do not interopt.

What happens when when a nebula host's cert expires? It continues running, but handshakes with other hosts will start to
fail.

Nebula is a peer-to-peer VPN, meaning by default it only routes to hosts that have the software installed with an
associated cert. If you want Nebula to function like OpenVPN, set up [unsafe routes](/docs/guides/unsafe_routes/).
