title: Upgrading to IPv6 support
summary:
  This guide describes how to take an existing nebula network and upgrade it to use the new v2 certificates and enable
  IPv6 addresses.

# Upgrading to IPv6 support

With newly added IPv6 support to nebula, there are a few steps that must be taken to enable it across your network.

## Upgrade to nebula nightly

First of all, download the updated nebula version that has v2 certs and IPv6 support from nightly releases, and move all
of the hosts in your network to it.

[https://github.com/NebulaOSS/nebula-nightly/releases](https://github.com/NebulaOSS/nebula-nightly/releases)

## Add a v2 Certificate Authority

Next, create a new CA for your network, and add it to the trust bundle of every host on the network. Creating a new CA
with the nightly version of nebula will create a v2 CA by default, with support for creating and signing both v1 and v2
certificates.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert ca -name "Nebula IPv6 Tutorial CA" -encrypt
Enter passphrase:
# typed in my password and pressed enter.
```

Using `nebula-cert print` we can see that this is a v2 certificate authority, with support for IPv6 addresses.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path ./ca.crt
{
        "curve": "CURVE25519",
        "details": {
                "groups": null,
                "isCa": true,
                "issuer": "",
                "name": "Nebula IPv6 Tutorial CA",
                "networks": null,
                "notAfter": "2026-03-11T12:26:19-05:00",
                "notBefore": "2025-03-11T12:26:19-05:00",
                "unsafeNetworks": null
        },
        "fingerprint": "a95ed86f7754fc5b0fcaf38473504403748d6dc422b16bc3e29fcae32af9a73c",
        "publicKey": "4f1200baedc57f39adfc71e1b5409a3a7dc60fab4e1a2c4decaeb347a2ad4d75",

        "version": 2
}
```

Add the public key of the CA to the `pki.ca` list in the config for every nebula host:

## Re-issue v1+v2 certificates for every host with the v2 CA

In order to move to a network where every host has ipv4 and ipv6, or every host has ipv6 only, it's recommended to start
by re-issuing all hosts certificates with both v1 and v2 certificates for compatibility. Hosts will continue handshaking
via the v1 cert while the network is being upgraded.

You can create a new v1+v2 cert like this:

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "nebula" -networks "192.168.1.1/24"
Enter passphrase:
# Entered my passphrase
```

By default, nebula-cert will create a v1 and v2 version of the certificate when creating and signing a certificate. This
allows you to move from v1 to v2 seamlessly. v1 does not support IPv6 though, so we'll move to only v2 soon.

Using `nebula-cert show` we can see that the certificate has both cert format versions:

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path nebula.crt

## Switch all relays to use v2 certificates

Switch all `am_relay: true` hosts' `pki.default_version` to `2` or add it if it doesn't exist yet.

Now, if a relay initiates a handshake, it will attempt to use a v2 cert first, but this is an uncommon flow.

## Switch all non-lighthouse hosts to use v2 certificates

Switch all `am_lighthouse: false` hosts' `pki.default_version` to `2` or add it if it doesn't exist yet. Lighthouses
will reply to v2 hosts using v2 protocols.

## Switch all lighthouses to use v2 certificates

Switch all `am_lighthouse: true` hosts' `pki.default_version` to `2` or add it if it doesn't exist yet. Now all of your
hosts should be using their v2 certificate for initiating tunnels.

## Re-issue v2 certificates for the hosts

Now that every host on the network is communicating via v2 certificates, you can remove the v1 certificates by reissuing
the certificates. Pass `-version 2` to only create certificates in the v2 certificate format. This will enable the non
backwards compatible features of the v2 certificates.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "nebula" -networks "192.168.1.1/24" -version 2
```

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path nebula.crt
{
        "curve": "CURVE25519",
        "details": {
                "groups": null,
                "isCa": false,

                        "192.168.1.1/24"
                ],
                "notAfter": "2026-03-11T12:26:18-05:00",
                "notBefore": "2025-03-17T16:06:48-05:00",

        "version": 2
}
```

You can also add an IPv6 address to your hosts now.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "nebula" -networks "192.168.1.1/24,fd0:0:0::1/64" -version 2
```

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path nebula.crt
{
        "curve": "CURVE25519",
        "details": {
                "groups": null,
                "isCa": false,
                "issuer": "a95ed86f7754fc5b0fcaf38473504403748d6dc422b16bc3e29fcae32af9a73c",

                "networks": [
                        "192.168.1.1/24",
                        "fd0::1/64"
                ],
                "notAfter": "2026-03-11T12:26:18-05:00",
                "notBefore": "2025-03-17T16:11:30-05:00",
                "unsafeNetworks": null
        },
        "fingerprint": "08e9d282adb0809457ad63982a9f1113a462763da58aa69b76d2b4cb1cd24724",

        "version": 2
}
```

Once you switch services over to use the new IPv6 addresses, you can decide to deprecate the IPv4 addresses or continue
to run your overlay network with both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.
