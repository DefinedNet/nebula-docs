# tun

```yml
tun:
  disabled: false
  dev: nebula1
  drop_local_broadcast: false
  drop_multicast: false
  tx_queue: 500
  mtu: 1300
  routes:
    - mtu: 8800
      route: 10.0.0.0/16
  unsafe_routes:
    - route: 172.16.1.0/24
      via: 192.168.100.99
      mtu: 1300 # mtu will default to tun mtu if this option is not specified
      install: true # controls whether this route is installed in the systems routing table.
```

## tun.disabled

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

Allows the nebula interface (tun) to be disabled, which lets you run a lighthouse without a nebula interface (and
therefore without root). You will not be able to communicate over IP with a nebula node that uses this setting.

## tun.dev

`dev` sets the interface name for your nebula interface. If not set, a default will be chosen by the OS. For macOS: Not
required. If set, must be in the form `utun[0-9]+`. For FreeBSD: Required to be set, must be in the form `tun[0-9]+`.

## tun.drop_local_broadcast

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

Toggles forwarding of local broadcast packets, the address of which depends on the ip/mask encoded in pki.cert

## tun.drop_multicast

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

Toggles forwarding of multicast packets

## tun.tx_queue

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 500</Pill>

Sets the transmit queue length, if you notice lots of transmit drops on the tun it may help to raise this number.
Default is 500.

## tun.mtu

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 1300</Pill> <Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable: Linux</Pill>

Default MTU for every packet, safe setting is (and the default) 1300 for internet routed packets.

See below for per-route overrides ([`tun.routes`](#tunroutes)).

## tun.routes

<Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

Route based MTU overrides. If you have known VPN IP paths that can support larger MTUs you can increase/decrease them
here. This will override the default MTU ([`tun.mtu`](#tunmtu)) for Nebula packets on a per-route basis.

```yml
tun:
  routes:
    - mtu: 8800
      route: 10.0.0.0/16
```

## tun.unsafe_routes

<Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

:::warning

The nebula certificate of the `via` node MUST have the `route` defined in the subnets list in its certificate or it will
silently refuse to route traffic.

:::

Unsafe routes allows you to route traffic over nebula to non-nebula nodes. Unsafe routes should be avoided unless you
have hosts/services that cannot run nebula.

```yml
tun:
  unsafe_routes:
    - route: 172.16.1.0/24
      via: 192.168.100.99
      mtu: 1300
      metric: 100
      install: true # controls whether this route is installed in the systems routing table.
```

For more information, see the [Extend network access beyond overlay hosts](/docs/guides/unsafe_routes/) guide.

### ECMP support for `unsafe_routes`

<Pill className="mb-24">Added in v1.10.0</Pill>

[Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing) is now available for
unsafe_routes, enabling load balancing and redundancy within a single host. You can now configure multiple gateways for
the same route on one host, with optional weighting for unequal load distribution.

```yaml
unsafe_routes:
  # Multiple gateways with equal weighting (default weight: 1)
  - route: 192.168.100.0/24
    via:
      - gateway: 10.0.0.1
      - gateway: 10.0.0.2

  # Multiple gateways with custom weights
  - route: 192.168.101.0/24
    via:
      - gateway: 10.0.0.1
        weight: 10
      - gateway: 10.0.0.2
        weight: 5
```

The implementation uses [hash-threshold mapping](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2992) (similar to the Linux kernel) to
distribute traffic based on packet hashing. When a gateway becomes unreachable, traffic automatically fails over to the
remaining available gateways, though load balancing may become uneven until the failed gateway recovers.

## tun.use_system_route_table

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

This option is only supported on Linux.

Set to true to manage unsafe routes directly on the system route table with gateway routes instead of in nebula
configuration files.
