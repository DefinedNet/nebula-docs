# tun

```yml
tun:
  disabled: false
  dev: nebula1
  drop_local_broadcast: false
  drop_multicast: false
  tx_queue: 500
  mtu: 1300
  routes:
    - mtu: 8800
      route: 10.0.0.0/16
  unsafe_routes:
    - route: 172.16.1.0/24
      via: 192.168.100.99
      mtu: 1300 #mtu will default to tun mtu if this option is not specified
```

## tun.disabled

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

Allows the nebula interface (tun) to be disabled, which lets you run a lighthouse without a nebula interface (and
therefore without root). You will not be able to communiate over IP with a nebula node that uses this setting.

## tun.dev

`dev` sets the interface name for your nebula interface. If not set, a default will be chosen by the OS. For macOS: Not
required. If set, must be in the form `utun[0-9]+`. For FreeBSD: Required to be set, must be in the form `tun[0-9]+`.

## tun.drop_local_broadcast

Toggles forwarding of local broadcast packets, the address of which depends on the ip/mask encoded in pki.cert

## tun.drop_multicast

Toggles forwarding of multicast packets

## tun.tx_queue

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 500</Pill>

Sets the transmit queue length, if you notice lots of transmit drops on the tun it may help to raise this number.
Default is 500.

## tun.mtu

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 1300</Pill>

Default MTU for every packet, safe setting is (and the default) 1300 for internet routed packets.

## tun.routes

Route based MTU overrides, you have known vpn ip paths that can support larger MTUs you can increase/decrease them here

```yml
routes:
  - mtu: 8800
    route: 10.0.0.0/16
```

## tun.unsafe_routes

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The nebula certificate of the “via” node MUST have the “route” defined as a subnet in its
certificate**

Unsafe routes allows you to route traffic over nebula to non-nebula nodes. Unsafe routes should be avoided unless you
have hosts/services that cannot run nebula.

```yml
unsafe_routes:
  - route: 172.16.1.0/24
    via: 192.168.100.99
    mtu: 1300
    metric: 100
```
