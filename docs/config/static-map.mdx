# static_map

The static map defines options which control the interpretation of the static_host_map.

Example:

```yml
static_map:
  network: ip4
  cadence: 30s
  lookup_timeout: 250ms
```

## static_map.network

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: ip4</Pill>

Select the IP version used to communicate with hosts in the static map. Valid values are `ip4`, `ip6`, and `ip` (for
both.)

:::caution

In general, this should be left as the default value `ip4` to avoid issues communicating with IPv4-only hosts.

Lighthouses learn each node's IP addresses by looking at the source address of incoming packets as well as the
self-reported addresses sent by the node. Because most devices are behind a NAT of some sort (e.g. a network router)
they cannot self-report their public IPv4 address. By contacting the Lighthouse via its IPv4 address, the Lighthouse is
able to learn the node's public IPv4 address.

It is necessary to set this setting to `ip6` (or `ip`) for IPv6-only hosts.

:::

## static_map.cadence

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 30s</Pill>

Interval to re-query DNS for hostnames listed in the static map

## static_map.lookup_timeout

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 250ms</Pill>

Timeout for DNS lookup of static hosts
