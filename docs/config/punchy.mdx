# punchy

`punchy` configures the sending of inbound/outbound packets at a regular interval to avoid expiration of firewall nat
mappings.

```yml
punchy:
  punch: true
  respond: true
  delay: 1s
```

## punchy.punch

`punch` enables its functionality, which causes the node to send small packets at the regular interval.

## punchy.respond

`respond` means that a node unable to receive handshakes will attempt to initiate a handshake to the host attempting to
establish a tunnel, which can be the case when hole punching fails in one direction. This can be extremely useful if one
node is behind a difficult nat, such as a symmetric NAT.

## punchy.delay

`delay` slows down punch responses, which can be helpful for misbehaving NATs or conditions where a NAT routerâ€™s
conntrack map is unable to handle a race, default is 1 second, respond must be true to take effect.
