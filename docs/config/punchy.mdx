# punchy

`punchy` configures the sending of inbound/outbound packets at a regular interval to avoid expiration of firewall nat
mappings.

```yml
punchy:
  punch: true
  respond: true
  delay: 1s
```

## punchy.punch

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

`punch` enables its functionality, which causes the node to send small packets at the regular interval.

## punchy.respond

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

`respond` means that a node unable to receive handshakes will attempt to initiate a handshake to the host attempting to
establish a tunnel, which can be the case when hole punching fails in one direction. This can be extremely useful if one
node is behind a difficult nat, such as a symmetric NAT.

## punchy.delay

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 1s</Pill>

`delay` slows down punch responses which can be helpful for conditions where a NAT is unable to handle certain race
conditions. `respond` must be true to take effect. Changing this value while running will not affect any in progress
operations, only new ones.
