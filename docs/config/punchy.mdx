# punchy

`punchy` configures the sending of inbound/outbound packets at a regular interval to avoid expiration of firewall NAT
mappings.

Regardless of how `punchy` is configured, the Lighthouse will notify hosts when a peer is attempting to handshake with
it and Nebula will issue an "empty" packet to the initiating peer's IP addresses in an attempt to punch a hole through
its own NAT.

```yml
punchy:
  punch: true
  delay: 1s
  respond: true
  respond_delay: 5s
```

## punchy.punch

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill>

When enabled, Nebula will periodically send "empty" packets to the underlay IP addresses of hosts it has established
tunnels to in order to maintain the "hole" punched in the NAT's firewall.

## punchy.delay

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 1s</Pill> <Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

`delay` is the period of time Nebula waits between receiving a Lighthouse handshake notification and sending an empty
packet in order to try to punch a hole in the NAT firewall. This is helpful in some NAT race condition situations.

## punchy.respond

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill> <Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

When enabled, the node will attempt a handshake to the initiating peer in response to the Lighthouse's notification of
the peer attempting to handshake with it. This can be useful when a node is behind a difficult NAT for which regular
hole punching does not work. Some combinations of NAT still will not work and [relays](/docs/config/relay/) can be used
for this scenario.

## punchy.respond_delay

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 5s</Pill> <Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

`respond_delay` is the period of time Nebula waits between receiving a Lighthouse handshake notification and attempting
its own "reverse" handshake with the initiating peer.
