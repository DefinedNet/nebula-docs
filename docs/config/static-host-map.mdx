# static_host_map

The static host map defines a set of hosts with fixed IP addresses on the internet (or any network). A host can have
multiple fixed IP addresses defined here, and nebula will try each when establishing a tunnel. The syntax is:

`"<nebula ip>": ["<routable ip/dns name>:<routable port>"]`

Example, if your lighthouse has the nebula IP of 192.168.100.1 and has the real ip address of 100.64.22.11 and runs on
port 4242:

```yml
static_host_map:
  '192.168.100.1': ['100.64.22.11:4242']
```
