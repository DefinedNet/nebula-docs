# cipher

**IMPORTANT: this value must be identical on ALL NODES/LIGHTHOUSES. We do not/will not support use of different ciphers simultaneously!**

`cipher` allows you to choose between the available ciphers for your network. The default is `aes`, and the available options are `chachapoly` or `aes`.

```yml
cipher: chachapoly
```
