# cipher

:::danger

This value must be identical on ALL NODES/LIGHTHOUSES. Nebula does not support use of different ciphers simultaneously!

:::

`cipher` allows you to choose between the available ciphers for your network. The default is `aes`, and the available
options are `chachapoly` or `aes`.

```yml
cipher: chachapoly
```
