# routines

`routines` is the number of thread pairs to run that consume from the tun and UDP queues.
Currently, this defaults to `1` which means we have `1` tun queue reader and `1`
UDP queue reader. Setting this above `1` will set `IFF_MULTI_QUEUE` on the tun
device and `SO_REUSEPORT` on the UDP socket to allow multiple queues.
This option is only supported on Linux.

The _maximum_ recommended setting is half of the available CPU cores. It's recommended to set this to a lower value still, to avoid resource starvation.
