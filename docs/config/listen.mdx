description: Configure the UDP port used for sending/receiving Nebula traffic on underlay networks.
---

import { Pill } from '@components/Pill/Pill';

# listen

`listen` sets the UDP port Nebula will use for sending/receiving traffic and for handshakes.

```yml
listen:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 4242
  batch: 64
  read_buffer: 10485760
  write_buffer: 10485760
```

## listen.host

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 0.0.0.0</Pill>

`host` is the ip of the interface to use when binding the listener. The default is `0.0.0.0` for all IPv4 interfaces. To
enable IPv6, use `'[::]'` instead. `host` may also contain a hostname.

## listen.port

`port` is the UDP port nebula should use on a host. For a lighthouse node, the port should be defined, conventionally to
`4242`, however using port 0 or leaving `port` unset will dynamically assign a port and is recommended for roaming
nodes. Using 0 on lighthouses and relay hosts will likely lead to connectivity issues.

## listen.batch

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 64</Pill>

Sets the max number of packets to pull from the kernel for each syscall (under systems that support `recvmmsg`).

## listen.read_buffer, listen.write_buffer

Configure socket buffers for the udp side (outside), leave unset to use the system defaults. Values will be doubled by
the kernel. Default is `net.core.rmem_default` and `net.core.wmem_default` (`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default` and
`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default`). Maximum is limited by memory in the system, `SO_RCVBUFFORCE` and `SO_SNDBUFFORCE` is
used to avoid having to raise the system wide max, `net.core.rmem_max` and `net.core.wmem_max`
