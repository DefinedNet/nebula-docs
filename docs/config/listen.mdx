# listen

listen sets the UDP port Nebula will use for sending/receiving traffic and for handshakes. The default here is 4242. For
a lighthouse node, the port should be defined, however using port 0 will dynamically assign a port and is recommended
for roaming nodes.

```yml
listen:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 4242
  batch: 64
  read_buffer: 10485760
  write_buffer: 10485760
```

## listen.host

`host` is the ip of the interface to use when binding the listener. The default is 0.0.0.0, which is what most people
should use.

## listen.port

`port` is the UDP port nebula should use on a host. Setting this to 0 will dynamically assign a port number.

## batch, read_buffer, write_buffer

Configure socket buffers for the udp side (outside), leave unset to use the system defaults. Values will be doubled by
the kernel. Default is `net.core.rmem_default` and `net.core.wmem_default` (`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default` and
`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default`). Maximum is limited by memory in the system, `SO_RCVBUFFORCE` and `SO_SNDBUFFORCE` is
used to avoid having to raise the system wide max, `net.core.rmem_max` and `net.core.wmem_max`
