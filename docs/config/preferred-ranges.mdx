# preferred_ranges

`preferred_ranges` sets the priority order for underlay ip addresses. Two hosts on the same LAN would likely benefit from having their tunnels use the LAN IP addresses rather than the public IP addresses the lighthouse may have learned for them.

Default `preferred_ranges` order: `ipv6` > `public ipv4` > `private ipv4`

NOTE: the previous option `local_range` only allowed definition of a single range
and has been deprecated for `preferred_ranges`

```yml
preferred_ranges: ['172.16.0.0/24']
```
