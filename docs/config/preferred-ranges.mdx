# preferred_ranges

`preferred_ranges` sets the priority order for underlay IP addresses. Two hosts on the same LAN would likely benefit from having their tunnels use the LAN IP addresses rather than the public IP addresses the lighthouse may have learned for them. `preferred_ranges` accepts a list of [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) ranges admitted as a set of preferred ranges of IP addresses.

> An underlay network is the network that a nebula [overlay network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network) maps onto. It is the LAN network that a host is connected to in addition to the wider internet.

How nebula orders underlay IP addresses it learns about:

Highest priority

- CIDR is in `preferred_ranges` set and is [ipv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)
- CIDR is in `preferred_ranges` set and is [public ipv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)
- CIDR is in `preferred_ranges` set and is [private ipv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Private_networks)
- CIDR is ipv6
- CIDR is public ipv4
- CIDR is private ipv4

Lowest priority

To set up a host that prefers local network `172.16.0.0/24` first, then `ipv6` then `public ipv4` then `private ipv4`, specify:

```yml
preferred_ranges: ['172.16.0.0/24']
```

This would add the network range `172.16.0.0/24` to the `preferred_ranges` set, which nebula will use to influence its ranking of options for underlay connections. If multiple types of ranges are specified, such as a private ipv4 range and an ipv6 range, they will be sorted as shown above. So, the ipv6 would be given priority, no matter its position in the `preferred_ranges` set.

:::info

The previous option [`local_range`](/config/local-range) only allowed definition of a single range
and has been deprecated and replaced by `preferred_ranges`.
