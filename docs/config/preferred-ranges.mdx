# preferred_ranges

Preferred ranges is used to define a hint about the local network ranges, which speeds up discovering the fastest
path to a network adjacent nebula node.
NOTE: the previous option `local_range` only allowed definition of a single range
and has been deprecated for `preferred_ranges`

```yml
preferred_ranges: ['172.16.0.0/24']
```
