# handshakes

## handshakes.try_interval

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 100ms</Pill>

Handshakes are sent to all known addresses at each interval with a linear backoff, waiting `try_interval` after the 1st
attempt, 2 \* `try_interval` after the 2nd, etc, until the handshake is older than timeout.

## handshakes.retries

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 10</Pill>

A 100ms interval with the default 10 retries will give a handshake 5.5 seconds to resolve before timing out.

## handshakes.trigger_buffer

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: 64</Pill>

`trigger_buffer` is the size of the buffer channel for quickly sending handshakes after receiving the response for
lighthouse queries.

```yml
handshakes:
  try_interval: 100ms
  retries: 10
  trigger_buffer: 64
```
