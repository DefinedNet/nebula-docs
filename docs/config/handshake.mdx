# handshakes

#handshakes:
  # Handshakes are sent to all known addresses at each interval with a linear backoff,
  # Wait try_interval after the 1st attempt, 2 * try_interval after the 2nd, etc, until the handshake is older than timeout
  # A 100ms interval with the default 10 retries will give a handshake 5.5 seconds to resolve before timing out
  #try_interval: 100ms
  #retries: 20
  # trigger_buffer is the size of the buffer channel for quickly sending handshakes
  # after receiving the response for lighthouse queries
  #trigger_buffer: 64
