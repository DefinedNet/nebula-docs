# local_range

:::caution

`local_range` has been deprecated in favor of [`preferred_ranges`](/docs/config/preferred-ranges/)

:::

`local_range` is used to define a hint about the local network range, which speeds up discovering the fastest path to a
network adjacent nebula node.

```yml
local_range: '172.16.0.0/24'
```
