# relay

:::caution

Relay support is new and therefore should be considered experimental. However, relays are a useful tool for solving
tricky connectivity issues between hosts that otherwise are unable to route packets to each other.

:::

```yml
relay:
  relays:
    - 192.168.100.1
  am_relay: false
  use_relays: true
```

## relay.relays

`relays` are a list of Nebula IPs that peers can use to relay packets to this host. IPs in this list must have
`am_relay` set to `true` in their configs, otherwise they will reject relay requests.

```yml
relays:
  - 192.168.100.1
  - <other Nebula VPN IPs of hosts used as relays to access me>
```

This list of relays is reported to the Lighthouse. When other nodes attempt to handshake with this host, the Lighthouse
will indicate its supported relays in addition to its known IP addresses.

## relay.am_relay

Set `am_relay` to true to permit other hosts to list my IP in their relays config. The default is false.

## relay.use_relays

Set `use_relays` to false to prevent this instance from attempting to establish connections through relays. The default
is true.
