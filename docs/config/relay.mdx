# relay

:::info

EXPERIMENTAL: relay support for networks that canâ€™t establish direct connections.

:::

```yml
relay:
  relays:
    - 192.168.100.1
  am_relay: false
  use_relays: true
```

## relay.relays

`relays` are a list of Nebula IPs that peers can use to relay packets to the host. IPs in this list must have `am_relay`
set to `true` in their configs, otherwise they will reject relay requests.

```yml
relays:
  - 192.168.100.1
  - <other Nebula VPN IPs of hosts used as relays to access me>
```

## relay.am_relay

Set `am_relay` to true to permit other hosts to list my IP in their relays config. The default is false.

## relay.use_relays

Set `use_relays` to false to prevent this instance from attempting to establish connections through relays. The default
is true.
