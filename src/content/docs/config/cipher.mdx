# cipher

:::danger

This value must be identical on ALL nodes and lighthouses. Nebula does not support the use of different ciphers
simultaneously!

:::

`cipher` allows you to choose between the available ciphers for your network. You may choose `chachapoly` to use the
ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher or `aes` for AES256-GCM.

Because most devices have hardware support for the AES instruction set (e.g. AES-NI), this is the recommended option.

```yml
cipher: aes
```
