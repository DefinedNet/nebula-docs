# sshd

`sshd` enables nebula's built-in debugging console, which can be accessed via ssh. It can expose informational and
administrative functions, and allows manual tweaking of various network settings when debugging or testing.

_Hint: To generate the host key run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key`. Be sure to set the ownership
appropriately, e.g. `chown root:root ssh_host_ed25519_key`_

```yml
sshd:
  enabled: true
  listen: 127.0.0.1:2222
  host_key: /path/to/ssh_host_ed25519_key
  authorized_users:
    - user: steeeeve
      keys:
        - '[ssh public key string]'
  trusted_cas:
    - '[ssh ca public key string]'
```

## sshd.enabled

<Pill className="mb-24">Default: False</Pill> <Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

`enabled` toggles this feature globally.

## sshd.listen

<Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

`listen` is used to specify the host ip and port number for the nebula debug console to listen on, port 22 is not
allowed for your safety.

## sshd.host_key

<Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

`host_key` points to a file containing the ssh host private key to use for the ssh server side of the console. In the
above example, `/path/to/ssh_host_ed25519_key` contains a PEM-encoded SSH host key. The following example shows a host
key inlined as a YAML multiline string.

```
sshd:
  host_key: |

```

:::warning

Do not use the above private key in your own config file. SSH host keys should be unique per host, and provide
authenticity that you are connecting to the correct server.

:::

You can generate a host key using the `ssh-keygen` command line utility.

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key -N "" < /dev/null`

## sshd.authorized_users, user, keys

<Pill className="mb-24">Reloadable</Pill>

These options are how you create `users` for the debug ssh daemon. Password authentication for the ssh debug console is
NOT supported.

# sshd.trusted_cas

As an alternative to (or in addition to) `authorized_users`, you may define a list of trusted SSH CA public keys. Any
SSH certificate signed by a trusted CA will be granted access to the SSH debug server.

If an SSH certificate contains at least one principal, the connecting username must match a principal in the
certificate. If no principals are specified in the certificate, any username can be used.
