# Upgrading a Nebula network to IPv6 overlay addresses

The upcoming release of Nebula (tenatively v1.10) will add support for IPv6-addressed Nebula hosts. To support the
feature, Nebula has upgraded to a v2 certificate format. While v1 certificates support only a single IPv4 address for a
given host, the v2 format allows multiple IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses. In this guide we will describe how to upgrade a
network to the v2 certificate format with IPv6 support.

Since Nebula v1.10 has yet to be released, we will first need to update every host on the network with a nightly build
of Nebula. Next, we will issue backwards-compatible v1+v2 certificate bundles to each host. After updating each host's
config with the new certificate bundle we will take a careful approach to switching over to the v2 certificate.

The basic steps are:

1. [Upgrade Nebula](#upgrade-nebula)
2. [Create a v2 Certificate Authority](#create-a-v2-certificate-authority)
3. [Issue v1+v2 certificates bundles](#issue-v1v2-certificates-bundles)
4. [Start handshaking with v2 certificates](#start-handshaking-with-v2-certificates)
5. [Remove v1 certificates from hosts](#remove-v1-certificates-from-hosts)

## Upgrade Nebula

First, update each host in your network to a nightly build of Nebula with support for v2 certificates.

- [https://hub.docker.com/r/nebulaoss/nebula-nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/nebulaoss/nebula-nightly)

## Create a v2 Certificate Authority

Next, create a v2 Certificate Authority and add it to the trust bundle of every host on the network. Creating a new CA
with the nightly version of Nebula will create a v2 CA by default. v2 CAs support creating and signing both v1 and v2
certificates.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert ca -name "My Nebula CA" -encrypt
Enter passphrase:
```

Using `nebula-cert print` we can see that this is a v2 certificate authority.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path ./ca.crt
{
	"curve": "CURVE25519",
	"details": {
		"groups": null,
		"isCa": true,
		"issuer": "",
		"name": "My Nebula CA",
		"networks": null,
		"notAfter": "2026-04-01T17:02:36-04:00",
		"notBefore": "2025-04-01T17:02:36-04:00",
		"unsafeNetworks": null
	},
	"fingerprint": "62aabc872783f1036c7075fa49302c306baa1efb2afe9966f08401f157b6ae75",

	"version": 2
}
```

Append the new CA certificate to the [`pki.ca` trust bundle](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/config/pki/#pkica) in the
config of every Nebula host and reload Nebula.

## Issue v1+v2 certificates bundles

Once the trust bundle of all hosts has been updated, we will issue v1+v2 certificate bundles using the new CA. We'll
configure hosts with both certificates, but continue to use the v1 certificate for now.

By default, nebula-cert will create both v1 and v2 versions of the certificate when creating and signing a certificate.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "host-1" -networks "192.168.1.1/24"
Enter passphrase:
# Entered my passphrase
```

Using `nebula-cert print` we can see that the file contains both versions of the certificate:

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path nebula.crt

		"curve": "CURVE25519",

}
```

Update the corresponding [`pki.cert` field](https://nebula.defined.net/docs/config/pki/#pkicert) with the contents of
the entire file, and **restart** Nebula. Nebula will continue to use the v1 certificate when initiating tunnels until we
update the `pki.initiating_version` config option. When another host initiates a tunnel, Nebula will respond with the
same certificate version it was presented.

:::note

When adding or removing either a v1 or v2 certificate from the `pki.cert` field, Nebula must be restarted. A reload is
insufficient for this change.

:::

## Start handshaking with v2 certificates

Once all hosts are configured with a v1+v2 certificate bundle, we can switch over to handshaking with the v2
certificate. To do this, we set the `pki.initiating_version` config option to 2.

We recommend slow rolling this change by starting with a small subset of hosts and verifying the change before rolling
it out widely. After updating the config option, reloading Nebula, and establishing a tunnel you can verify the v2
certificate is in use via the `print-tunnel` command from [debug SSH server](/docs/guides/debug-ssh-commands/).

In this example we've updated host-1 (192.168.1.1) with `pki.initiating_version` set to 2 and restarted Nebula. Since
its default version is set to 2, it'll use the v2 certificate when handshaking with the Lighthouse. Because the
Lighthouse has a v1+v2 bundle configured it is able to complete the connection, even though its `pki.initiating_version`
is still set to 1.

:::note

If the Lighthouse were configured with only a v1 certificate, host-1 would not be able to connect, even though it has a
v1+v2 certificate bundle configured. This is because `pki.initiating_version` indicates the certificate version that
should be used in outgoing handshakes. If the receiving end does not support v2 certificates, the initiator will not
fallback on a v1 certificate.

You may also look in the host logs for the `certVersion` field in handshakes, ex:

```bash
time="2025-03-27T16:50:26-05:00" level=info msg="Handshake message received" certName=lighthouse1 certVersion=2 durationNs=63460958 fingerprint=84cf960de2e49f7560a5c7f876857528f02ab201c906f5a094d0d3294732b655 handshake="map[stage:2 style:ix_psk0]" initiatorIndex=530355834 issuer=a95ed86f7754fc5b0fcaf38473504403748d6dc422b16bc3e29fcae32af9a73c remoteIndex=530355834 responderIndex=3163624101 sentCachedPackets=1 udpAddr="172.17.0.3:4242" vpnAddrs="[192.168.1.2]"
```

## Remove v1 certificates from hosts

Now that every host on the network is communicating via v2 certificates, you can remove the v1 certificates by reissuing
the certificates. Pass `-version 2` to only create certificates in the v2 certificate format.

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "host-1" -networks "192.168.1.1/24" -version 2
```

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path host-1.crt
{
	"curve": "CURVE25519",
	"details": {
		"groups": null,
		"isCa": false,
		"issuer": "62aabc872783f1036c7075fa49302c306baa1efb2afe9966f08401f157b6ae75",
		"name": "host-1",
		"networks": [
			"192.168.1.1/24"
		],
		"notAfter": "2026-04-01T17:02:35-04:00",
		"notBefore": "2025-04-01T20:40:00-04:00",
		"unsafeNetworks": null
	},
	"fingerprint": "05930841ba198874b932504de1cceb26e8d84b931ea29c673e22e0be06fb75f0",
	"publicKey": "501410109bd531fc5af3c75019cd2ed8349abfb56e3299a30ff72773300d1a4a",
	"signature": "fa1db2751fcbd6db73133364075f1577e17c3db4009bb84a7d82f159aaa4e17bb3b43636295567abda3ba9c9ad4cd5ed6357fffb8c93ebc299f3f8809e3aeb0e",
	"version": 2
}
```

At this point, you may wish to assign an IPv6 address:

```bash
❯ nebula-cert sign -name "host-1" -networks "192.168.1.1/24,fdc8:d0db:a315:cb00::1/64" -version 2
```

```bash
❯ nebula-cert print -path host-1.crt
{
	"curve": "CURVE25519",
	"details": {
		"groups": null,
		"isCa": false,
		"issuer": "62aabc872783f1036c7075fa49302c306baa1efb2afe9966f08401f157b6ae75",
		"name": "host-1",
		"networks": [
			"192.168.1.1/24",
			"fdc8:d0db:a315:cb00::1/64"
		],
		"notAfter": "2026-04-01T17:02:35-04:00",
		"notBefore": "2025-04-01T20:38:21-04:00",
		"unsafeNetworks": null
	},
	"fingerprint": "2eda0f2dc5c5f8b097a09027fc896c9b6ba78d8fdac1559878caccd4c947e3ff",
	"publicKey": "d8ebf7a93e62044eee4bc504aa2e82e80d79db11cfee37c75b3769df261d343b",
	"signature": "5a5987e2e7e0e8619b0b111d951b3297f2c704387a032f84876172a3f1864e7fb2a5bf2ce48f3fa48ff6f60d39749ba3444b073485f6a9d41c6d3c9d7856f104",
	"version": 2
}
```

Once you switch services over to use the new IPv6 addresses, you can decide to deprecate the IPv4 addresses or continue
to run your overlay network with both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. If you decide to switch to IPv6-only, don't forget to
update your `static_host_map`.
